    <span class="introblock">Now that you've answered my questions, here are a few related details:</span>
  </h2>
  <ul class="facts">
    <li>
      I am 6'4", which is tall enough that people often comment on it, like I had no idea. Though, to be fair, sometimes I forget myself when I reach for something and realize that my arms extend out as far as they do.
    </li>
    <li>
      I was born in Washington State, and if I have my way, I'll never leave permanently. We're all spoiled by the grandeur of Mother Nature here, and I try not to take it for granted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gloomy weather can have its effect on me, but for the most part I actually enjoy the rain. Falling asleep to the sound of it is very soothing, and a reminder that even when it's miserable outside, there are still benefits (in addition to keeping everything so green!)
    </li>
    <li>
      I've always enjoyed going to Seahawks games, but I didn't become a serious fan until after the team's first Super Bowl run in 2005/2006. I watched the playoffs with my roommates at the time, and really enjoyed the experience, so I decided to watch the regular season games, too. Because of this, I find the idea of "fair weather" fans to be kind of silly. We're all fair weather fans until we're not!
    </li>
    <li>
      While I've always lived in Washington, I've moved around quite a bit, spending elementary school in Federal Way, junior high and high school in Sumner, and college up in Bellingham, and that's far from a comprehensive list of everywhere I've lived. In fact, I've moved so often that whenever anyone I know asks for help moving, I'm always up for it, because it's something I've done so much of myself (and I've always appreciated the help I've received!)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>As far as my background goes, after high school, I went to Western Washington University, where I got a bachelor's degree in general studies. Since then, I've worked at my alma mater as a transcriber and at Apple Retail. I'm looking forward to what's next as I embark on a career of coding!</p>
